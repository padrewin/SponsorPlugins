**ColdPouch** is a Minecraft plugin that adds customizable pouches to your server. Players can open these pouches to receive rewards, and each pouch can be configured with different textures, names, economies, and more.<br>
- Since the good old plugin **MoneyPouch** was not updated since 2021, here you have it! A newer and updated version that will work for 1.13 up to 1.21 versions. Read the features section to see the updates.
- This is a continuation of the original MoneyPouch plugin by LMBishop which can be found [here](https://github.com/LMBishop/MoneyPouch).

## üì¶ Features

- **Customizable Pouches**: Create and configure unique pouches, including using custom player head textures.
- **Economy Integration**: Support for Vault, LemonMobCoins, and other customizable economy systems.
- **Configurable Messages**: Customize the messages displayed to players during pouch interactions.
- **Permission System**: Control access to different pouches via permissions.
- **Shop System**: Includes an in-game shop where players can purchase pouches using various currencies.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Download the plugin**: Download the latest version of the ColdPouch plugin from [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/authors/padrecxsh.2013368/) page.
2. **Install the plugin**: Copy the `.jar` file into your server's `plugins` directory.
3. **Configure the plugin**: Run the server for the first time to generate the configuration files, then stop it. Edit the `config.yml` file to customize the plugin to your liking.
